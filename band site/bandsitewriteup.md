# Band Site Write-Up
## Beginnings
Linus, Chris S., Igor and I decided we would be a modern punk band called Pinkin Lark. We each took pictures of each other's faces so that Chris could edit them onto a picture of the band. It turned out perfectly! So funny. Chris also worked on editing our logo (so just switching the "P" and "L" in the regular Linkin Park logo). While that was going on, we decided that I would host and manage the site, so I made an index.html file for the main branch that we could all grab and start working on.

## Branches
This was the hardest part of the project for all of us. I felt like I (at least) had constant questions on how to merge my changes onto the main branch. I eventually figured out how to, but I was pretty frustrated the entire time. It was especially frustrating in the beginning because something I was trying to merge from my branch onto the main one said I needed to resolve some issues. I couldn't figure out how to do this, so I just closed the pull request, haha.

## Pictures and Paragraphs
Chris and Igor worked pretty hard on getting the pictures uploaded and formatting colors and fonts and such, while I focused on managing requests and writing my paragraph. Linus was also working on his paragraph, too. I probably missed some conversation that was happening, since my computer started dying and I had to sit on the opposite side of the room to get my computer plugged in. The pictures look great, but we had to resize the top logo a bit because it was just way too big. I made an assets folder for all of us on GitHub so we could just host all the pictures there and use those links from github.com to insert on our website. As for my paragraph, I just made some stuff up. Apparently, I play the hurdy-gurdy.

## Final Thoughts
This was fun but overall really frustrating. I really don't like the pushing and pulling mechanics, but that's probably just because I don't really understand them quite yet. It's also frustrating because I'm waiting for our website to update on Chrome and it hasn't yet and we're presenting in a few minutes AH!!
