## Haiku.aiff Write-Up

-- First, I googled how to record Mac's text-to-speech in Terminal. I found this great [article](https://www.iclarified.com/2922/how-to-record-text-to-speech-using-terminal) that explained exactly how to do it!
-- I opened Terminal and navigated to my GitHub folder by dragging the folder from Finder into Terminal.
-- Then, I used this command line listed in step six of the article: `say -v Fred "haiku.aiff"`
-- I entered text from Isaac Asimov's Short Story, _The Last Question_. You can read a .pdf of the story [here](https://www.physics.princeton.edu/ph115/LQ.pdf). My quote is a compilation of dialogue from page 8.
-- After I hit enter in Terminal, I opened my GitHub folder in the Finder window to make sure the file was there. It was! Very exciting.
-- This assignment was really cool, and I'm excited to use this knowledge going forward. It would be great for a producer tag or something!
