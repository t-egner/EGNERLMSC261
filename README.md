This is where all of my work from the SP'22 Intro to Computer Programming lives.
### Summary of Ford Article, Section 2
-- At their most basic, computers operate on two binary numbers, based on a set of instructions, then put that resulting number in its own box
-- The only real advantage computers have over humans is speed
-- So many seemingly mundane objects are actually computers, like air conditioners and watches!
-- A computer's hardware is the material, and the code is the art. Yes, coding is an art form!
-- To be a successful coder, you have to be willing to comb through a computer's logic backwards in order to figure out how it all works. Fun!
-- Hardware companies are not immune to the chokehold of capitalism. That's why open-source (like Linux) and free software (like Google's suite of apps) have taken over
-- Software hasn't always come with hardware, isn't that funny? But now, the two are totally inextricable
-- Devs run the world, periodt.
-- 88% of spreadsheeits in Excel contain errors! What?
-- How do you make code have energy? You run software that turns it into machine language, which is the most basic way computers "think."
-- Mistakes matter. Computers are dumb. They require precise-ness.
-- Sometimes, algorithim simply means software.
-- algorithims are simply a function, which can more simply be called a run
-- Inefficiences are bogged down in the idea that computers are good at math. They sometimes get overwhelmed. We, as coders, need to remember This
-- Lots of algorithims on top of each other mean that computers can feel more like humans, like Siri
-- That's my question too, why is it so difficult for men to engage with women in their field, especially if it's a technical one? I'm so tired of it. I'm exhausted. I don't even know what to do about it. I dress im baggy clothes. I dress pretty. I wear makeup, I don't. But everytime. It comes down to me having tits (small ones at that) and a vagina. Why? Dear god, why? I just want to be a person, not a woman. Geez.
-- Here's my opnion (though you didn't ask for it): women are taught from a young age that they just. Can't. Do. It. I remember so many times, my dad told me I can't do it. So many times, my teachers in high school told my I could'nt do it. And I believed them. Luckily, since then, I've changed my mind. I've only ever met one man who believed me at my word that I could do it. And that sucks.
